## CSE570: Compilers
## Code by Aaron Chamberlain for Professor Ernesto Gomez, Spring 2017 at CSUSB

This repository is for labs and projects relating to the Compilers class of Spring
2017 at California State University San Bernardino. I plan on writing all labs in Rust,
so the following build instructions should apply to all submitted code.

### Build instructions
1) Start by installing rust, the easiest way is via rustup, which is one curl away
as described [here.][install-rust]

2) Change directories into the unzipped code folder.

3) Run 'cargo build' to build a debug version of the code.

4) Run the code via './target/debug/lab1 [input]', where 'lab1' is replaced with the folder name you are currently in.
